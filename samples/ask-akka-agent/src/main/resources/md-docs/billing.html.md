# Billing

Akka provides detailed billing information to help organizations monitor and manage the operational costs associated with their projects. Users with the **billing-admin** role can view:

- **  Cost breakdown**   for each project in the organization.
- **  Month-to-date aggregate cost**  .
- **  Cost forecast**   based on current and projected usage across all projects.

Billing data is accessible only to users with the **billing-admin** role. For more information on assigning this role, see the [Assigning the billing-admin Role](about:blank#assigning_billing_admin) section below.

## [](about:blank#_billing_interface) Billing Interface

For **billing-admin** users, a billing icon appears in the [Akka Console’s](https://console.akka.io/) side navigation. Clicking this icon opens the billing interface, where users can select the billing month and organization to view detailed billing data.

If a user is a billing admin for multiple organizations, they can switch between organizations in the billing UI.

![Akka Billing User Interface](../_images/billing-ui.jpg) In the billing UI:

- **  Month-to-date costs**   and a**  cost forecast**   for the current month are displayed in the upper-right corner.
- Billing data for each project within the selected organization is broken down into the following categories:  

  - **    Network Data Transfer**     : Charges for data transfer across all services, measured in GB.
  - **    Data Operations**     : Total read and write operations for all services.
  - **    Data Persistence**     : Total amount of data persisted during the month, measured in GB-Hours.

These are all metered at the project, region, service scope and you can see the totals across organization, project, region, or service as you choose.

## [](about:blank#assigning_billing_admin) Assigning the billing-admin Role

The organization superuser can assign the billing-admin role in one of two ways:

1. **  Invite a User**   : Use the following command to invite a user to the organization and assign the billing-admin role:  


```command
akka organizations invitations create --organization <organization name> \
--email <email address> --role billing-admin
```
2. **  Assign an Existing User**   : If the user is already a member, the superuser can assign the billing-admin role directly:  


```command
akka organization users add-binding --organization <organization name> \
  --email <email address> --role billing-admin
```

For more details on managing users and their roles, see the [Managing organization users](manage-users.html) section.
