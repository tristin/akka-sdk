# Configure message brokers

Akka eventing integrates with *Google Cloud Pub/Sub* and managed Kafka services such as *Confluent Cloud*, *Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)* , and *Aiven for Apache Kafka* to enable asynchronous messaging and integrations with other systems.

Message brokers are configured at the Akka project level. A project can have one broker configuration. Akka eventing is independent of the broker technology.

## [](about:blank#_broker_services) Broker services

Follow the detailed steps to configure the desired message broker service for use with your Akka project:

- [  Google Pub/Sub](broker-google-pubsub.html)
- [  Confluent Cloud](broker-confluent.html)
- [  Amazon MSK](broker-aws-msk.html)
- [  Aiven for Apache Kafka](broker-aiven.html)

We continuously evaluate additional integrations for potential built-in support in Akka. If you have specific requirements, please contact us at [support@akka.io](mailto:support@akka.io).

For running Akka services that integrate with a message broker locally, see [running a service with broker support](../../java/running-locally.html#_local_broker_support).
