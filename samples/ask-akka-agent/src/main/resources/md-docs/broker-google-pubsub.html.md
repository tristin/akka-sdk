# Using Google Cloud Pub/Sub as message broker

To configure access to your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker for your Akka project, you need to create a Google service account with access to your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker and provide it to Akka.

Details on doing this can be found in the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) . We provide simplified steps below.

The service account should allow for the `roles/pubsub.editor` [role](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#roles).

## [](about:blank#set-pubsub-service) Setting up the service account

To set up a service account and generate the key, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to[  https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)  .
2. From the blue bar, click the dropdown menu next to**  Google Cloud Platform**  .
3. Click**  New Project**   to create a project and save the `<gcp-project-id>`   , which you will need later.
4. Enter the following `gcloud`   command to set up the `gcloud`   environment:  


```command
gcloud auth login
gcloud projects list
gcloud config set project <gcp-project-id>
```
5. Enter the following command to create the service account. The example uses the name `akka-broker`   , but you can use any name.  


```command
gcloud iam service-accounts create akka-broker
```
6. Enter the following commands to grant the GCP Pub/Sub editor role to the service account. Substitute your project ID for `<gcp-project-id>`  .  


```command
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <gcp-project-id> \
    --member "serviceAccount:akka-broker@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role "roles/pubsub.editor"
```
7. Generate a key file for your service account:  


```command
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create keyfile.json \
    --iam-account akka-broker@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Now you have a service account key file with which to configure Akka to use your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker. You can add the key file using either the Akka Console or the Akka CLI.

Browser
1. Open the project in the Akka Console.
2. Select**  Integrations**   from the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Click**  +**   for the Google Cloud Pub/Sub integration option.
4. Copy the contents of `keyfile.json`   into the editor and, click**  Apply**  .

The project is now configured to use Google Pub/Sub as the message broker.

CLI
```command
akka projects config set broker \
  --broker-service google-pubsub \
  --gcp-key-file keyfile.json \
  --description "Google Pub/Sub in <gcp-project-id>"
```

The project is now configured to use Google Pub/Sub as the message broker.

### [](about:blank#_create_a_topic) Create a topic

To create a topic, you can either use the Google Cloud Console, or the Google Cloud CLI.

Browser
1. Open the Google Cloud Console.
2. Go to the Pub/Sub product page.
3. Click**  CREATE TOPIC**   on the top of the screen.
4. Fill in the Topic ID field and choose any other options you need.
5. Click**  CREATE TOPIC**   in the modal dialog.

You can now use the topic to connect with Akka

Google Cloud CLI
```command
gcloud pubsub topics create TOPIC_ID
```

You can now use the topic to connect with Akka

## [](about:blank#_delivery_characteristics) Delivery characteristics

When your application consumes messages from Google Pub/Sub, it will try to deliver messages to your service in 'at-least-once' fashion while preserving order.

- the GCP 'Subscription' has the 'Message ordering' flag enabled (this is the case by default for the subscriptions created by Akka)
- the code that acts as a publisher has 'message ordering' enabled (if needed on this client SDK)
- an ordering key is[  provided for each message](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher#using-ordering-keys)

When passing messages to a certain entity or using them to update a view row by specifying the id as the Cloud Event `ce-subject` attribute on the message, the same id must be used for the Google Pub/Sub ordering key to guarantee that the messages are processed in order by the entity or view.

|  | Correct ordering is especially important for topics that stream directly into views using the `transform_update`   option: when messages for the same subject id are spread over different ordering keys (or do not have ordering keys), they may read stale data and lose updates. |

To achieve at-least-once delivery, messages that are not acknowledged before the [Ack deadline](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber#subscription-workflow) will be redelivered. This means redeliveries of 'older' messages may arrive behind fresh deliveries of 'newer' messages.

When publishing messages to Google Pub/Sub from Akka, the `ce-subject` attribute, if present, is used as the ordering key for the message.
