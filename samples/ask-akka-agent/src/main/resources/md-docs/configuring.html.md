# Configuring self-managed nodes

For organizations that want control over how Akka services are installed, updated, and maintained. Akka services are packaged into standalone binaries with Akka clustering for scaling. You are responsible for separately managing secure connectivity, routes, installation, deployment, and persistence.

## [](about:blank#_license_key) License key

You can retrieve a free license key from [akka.io/key](https://account.akka.io/key).

Define the key in your `application.conf`:


```none
akka.license-key = "<your key>"
```

## [](about:blank#_database) Database

Akka requires a Postgres database. The tables will be created automatically, but you need to create the database and the credentials to connect to the database.

You define a connection configuration in your `application.conf` or use the predefined environment variables.


```none
akka.persistence.r2dbc {
  connection-factory {
    host = "localhost"
    host = ${?DB_HOST}
    port = 5432
    port = ${?DB_PORT}
    database = "postgres"
    database = ${?DB_DATABASE}
    user = "postgres"
    user = ${?DB_USER}
    password = ${?DB_PASSWORD}
  }
}
```

Supported environment variables:

- DB_HOST
- DB_PORT
- DB_DATABASE
- DB_USER
- DB_SSL_ENABLED - `true`   to enable SSL
- DB_SSL_MODE - allow, prefer, require, verify-ca, verify-full, tunnel
- DB_SSL_ROOT_CERT - Server root certificate. Can point to either a resource within the classpath or a file.
- DB_SSL_CERT - Client certificate. Can point to either a resource within the classpath or a file.
- DB_SSL_KEY - Key for client certificate. Can point to either a resource within the classpath or a file.
- DB_SSL_PASSWORD - Password for client key.

You find more configuration options in [reference documentation](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/config.html).

## [](about:blank#_build_a_container_image) Build a container image

Build a container image of the service for standalone use by activating the `standalone` maven profile:


```command
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pstandalone
```

Push the image to your container registry.

## [](about:blank#_try_it_locally) Try it locally

You can try running the image locally with docker compose:

1. docker-compose.yml  


```yml
version: "3"
services:
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_db
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    healthcheck:
      test: [ 'CMD', 'pg_isready', "-q", "-d", "postgres", "-U", "postgres" ]
      interval: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 5s
      timeout: 5s

  shopping-cart-service:
    image: shopping-cart-quickstart:1.0-SNAPSHOT-20250407061652
    container_name: shopping-cart-service
    depends_on:
      - postgres-db
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      # jvm -D properties can be added under this environment map (note: remove this comment when adding properties)
      JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: >

      # those variables are defined in the .env file
      STANDALONE_SINGLE_NODE:
        true
      DB_HOST:
        "postgres-db"
```

Update the `image:` of the `shopping-cart-service` in the `docker-compose.yml` with the specific image name and version you installed.

Run with:


```command
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

## [](about:blank#_deploy_to_kubernetes) Deploy to Kubernetes

You need to create and operate the Kubernetes cluster yourself. Cloud and on-premises Kubernetes are supported.

You need the following Kubernetes files:

1. namespace.yml  


```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-namespace
```
2. rbac.yml  

  For Akka Cluster bootstrap and rolling updates we need to define role based access control.  


```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: shopping-cart-namespace
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
  - apiGroups: [ "apps" ]
    resources: [ "replicasets" ]
    verbs: [ "get", "list" ]

                  optional: true
```

  Update the `image:`   in the `deployment.yml`   with the specific image version and location you published.
4. service.yml  


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: shopping-cart-service
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
```

Update all `shopping-cart` naming to your own names.

### [](about:blank#_apply_with_kubectl) Apply with kubectl

Deploy to Kubernetes with:


```shell
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=shopping-cart-namespace
kubectl apply -f rbac.yml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f service.yml

# all should be in ready state
kubectl get pods
```

As a first test you can create a port forward with:


```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/shopping-cart-service-svc 9000:9000
```

Then you can access the endpoints at `http:localhost:9000/`.

## [](about:blank#_deploy_to_any_other_container_image_platform) Deploy to any other container image platform

The standalone image can be run in most container image platforms.

When running more than one instance of the service they must form an Akka cluster. This is done automatically in a Kubernetes environment, but must be configured within container runtime platforms.. Many container platforms are not designed to support cluster-based systems that need discovery and network connectivity to enable scale and resilience. The nodes must support peer-to-peer TCP connectivity, by default on port 25520. See [reference documentation](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/cluster.html#joining) for more details about cluster formation.

If clustering is not an option in your environment you can run it as a single instance by defining the following configuration in your `application.conf`:


```none
akka.runtime.standalone.single-node = true
```

Make sure that there is only one instance running at the same time, for example rolling updates would not be supported.

## [](about:blank#_configuration) Configuration

### [](about:blank#_endpoint_configuration) Endpoint configuration

The port that the HTTP server binds to can be configured with environment variable `HTTP_PORT` or:


```none
kalix.proxy.http-port = 9000
```

### [](about:blank#_service_to_service_eventing_configuration) Service to Service Eventing configuration

By default, the service name defined in `@Consume.FromServiceStream` is used as the host name when connecting to the producing service. That can be logical dns name such as a Kubernetes service name.

You can define gRPC client configuration for a service name in the `application.conf` , such as:


```none
akka.grpc.client {
  "shopping-cart-service" {
    host = "shopping-cart-service-svc"
    port = 9000
    use-tls = false
  }
}
```

Note that you are responsible for setting up access control and TLS between services.

You find more configuration options in [reference documentation](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-grpc/current/client/configuration.html#by-configuration).

### [](about:blank#_kafka_message_broker_configuration) Kafka message broker configuration

If you use Kafka as message broker the configuration can be defined in your `application.conf`:


```none
akka.runtime.message-broker {
    support = "kafka"
    kafka {
      consumer = ${akka.kafka.consumer}
      producer = ${akka.kafka.producer}
      committer = ${akka.kafka.committer}
      connection-checker {
        enable = on
        max-retries = 5
        check-interval = 1 second
        backoff-factor = 2
      }

      # One or more bootstrap servers, comma separated.
      bootstrap-servers = ""
      bootstrap-servers = ${?BROKER_SERVERS}

      # Supported are
      # NONE (for easy local/dev mode with no auth at all)
      # PLAIN (for easy local/dev mode - plaintext, for non dev-mode TLS)
      # SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-512 (TLS)
      auth-mechanism = "NONE"
      auth-mechanism = ${?BROKER_AUTH_MECHANISM}
      auth-username = ""
      auth-username = ${?BROKER_USERNAME}
      auth-password = ""
      auth-password = ${?BROKER_PASS}
      broker-ca-pem-file = ""
      broker-ca-pem-file = ${?BROKER_CA_CERT}
   }
}
```

You find more configuration options in reference documentation:

- [  producer settings](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/alpakka-kafka/current/producer.html#settings)
- [  consumer settings](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/alpakka-kafka/current/consumer.html#settings)

### [](about:blank#_more_advanced_configuration) More advanced configuration

There are many things that can be configured to control the Akka runtime behavior. Please [ask support](https://akka.io/contact-us) .  and we will guide you to the right way to adjust the configuration for what you need.

A few examples of things that can be configured:

- Akka Cluster and TLS within the cluster
- Akka Cluster Sharding
- Persistence and Projections
- TLS for communication between services
- Metrics
