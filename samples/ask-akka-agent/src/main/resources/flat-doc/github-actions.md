# CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Use the Akka [setup-akka-cli-action, window="new"](https://github.com/akka/setup-akka-cli-action) GitHub Action to use GitHub Actions with your Akka project. The action supports commands for installing, authenticating, and invoking the Akka CLI. Releases are tracked [on the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/lightbend/setup-akka-action/releases).

## Prerequisites

To use the Akka GitHub Action, you’ll need to:

* Create a [service token](operations:integrating-cicd/index.adoc#create_a_service_token) for your project
* Get the UUID of your project, which can be obtained by running `akka projects list`

## Configure variables

The GitHub Action uses two required variables to authenticate and set the project you want to work on correctly:

* `AKKA_TOKEN`: The Akka service token
* `AKKA_PROJECT_ID`: The project ID for the Akka project you’re using

These variables should be configured as [secrets, window="new"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for your repository.

## Create a workflow

Follow these steps to create a workflow to invoke the GitHub Action for your project:

1. Create a folder named `.github` at the root of the project folder.
2. Create a file named `config.yml` in the `.github` folder.
3. Open `config.yml` for editing and add:

   ```yaml

   name: akka

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Install Akka CLI
           uses: akka/setup-akka-cli-action@v1
           with:
             token: ${{ secrets.AKKA_TOKEN }} ①
             project-id: ${{ secrets.AKKA_PROJECT_ID }} ②
         - name: List services ③
           run: akka service list ④
   ```
   1. The Akka authentication token.
   2. The UUID of the project to which the service belongs.
   3. A unique name for this workflow step. The example lists Akka services.
   4. The command to execute.
