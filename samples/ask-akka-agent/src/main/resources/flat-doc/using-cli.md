# Using the Akka CLI

The Akka command-line interface (CLI) complements the browser-based [Akka Console, window="new"](https://console.akka.io) user interface (UI), allowing you to perform deployment and configuration operations directly from the command line. This page provides an overview of common commands.

<dl><dt><strong>💡 TIP</strong></dt><dd>

Check regularly to ensure you have the latest version of the `akka` CLI. You can check the installed version by running:

```shell
akka version
```

For instructions on updating, see [installing and updating](reference:cli/installation.adoc).
</dd></dl>

## Basic CLI Usage

The general structure of an Akka CLI command is:
```shell
akka <command> [sub-command] [parameters] --[flags]
```
Flags, which modify command behavior, are always preceded by `--`.

## Logging In

Before using the `akka` CLI, you must authenticate with your Akka account. To initiate the login process, run:

```shell
akka auth login
```

This command opens the Akka console login screen in your default web browser. The CLI will display `Waiting for UI login...` while you authenticate. Once authorization is complete, the CLI returns to the command prompt.

Upon successful authentication:

* If you have one project, it is automatically set as the `current` project.
* If no projects exist, you’ll need to create one and set it manually.
* If you have multiple projects, you’ll need to specify the target project manually (see below).

To set your current project:
```shell
akka config set project my-project
```

For more authentication options:
```shell
akka auth -h
```

### Handling Proxies

In corporate environments with HTTP proxy servers that don’t support HTTP/2, you may encounter issues since the `akka` CLI uses gRPC. To bypass these limitations, you can configure the CLI to use grpc-web, which works over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

Log in with grpc-web enabled:
```shell
akka auth login --use-grpc-web
```

If you’re already logged in but need to switch to grpc-web, configure it with:
```shell
akka config set api-server-use-grpc-web true
```

## Managing Projects

The Akka CLI allows you to create, list, and configure projects.

### Creating a New Project

To create a new project within your organization:
```shell
akka projects new sample-project "An example project in Akka"
```

This creates a project named `sample-project` with the description `"An example project in Akka"`.

To set this new project as your current project:
```shell
akka config set project sample-project
```

### Listing Projects

To list all projects accessible within your organization:
```shell
akka projects list
```

The CLI displays a list of available projects, with the current project marked by an asterisk (`*`).

## Managing Container Registry Credentials

To allow Akka services to pull images from private Docker registries, add container registry credentials with the following command:
```shell
akka docker add-credentials \
  --docker-server https://mydockerregistry.com \
  --docker-username myself \
  --docker-password secret
```

Required flags:
* `--docker-server` (e.g., `https://mydockerregistry.com`)
* `--docker-username` (your Docker username)
* `--docker-password` (your Docker password)

For more information about using the Akka Container Registry (ACR) or external container registries, see [operations:projects/container-registries.adoc](operations:projects/container-registries.adoc).

## Managing Services

The `akka services` commands allow you to interact with services in your current Akka project.

### Listing Services

To list all services in the current project:
```shell
akka services list
```

The CLI displays a summary of all services, including their names and statuses.

### Deploying a Service

To deploy a service using a Docker image, run:
```shell
akka services deploy my-service my-container-uri/container-name:tag-name
```

Ensure you’ve set up your container registry credentials before deploying. For more details, see [container registry](operations:projects/container-registries.adoc) page.

### Exposing a route for inbound traffic

To expose a service for inbound traffic:
```shell
akka services expose my-service --enable-cors
```

This command creates a route for the specified service, with the option to enable HTTP CORS using the `--enable-cors` flag.

### Viewing Service Logs

To view logs from a specific service:
```shell
akka services logs my-service --follow
```

This command streams the logging output for the service.

### Viewing Service Details

To view detailed information about a service:
```shell
akka services get my-service
```

This command returns a detailed description of the service’s configuration and status.

### Inspecting Service Components

Akka services consist of one or more components. You can list and inspect these components using the following commands.

To list the components of a service:
```shell
akka services components my-service list
```

The CLI will display a list of components for the specified service:
```shell
NAME                                     TYPE           TYPE ID
com.example.api.ShoppingCartController   HttpEndpoint
com.example.api.ShoppingCartEntity       KeyValueEntity shopping-cart
```

This table shows the component names, their types, and any associated type IDs.

If you want to view the events from an event sourced entity you can use the `akka service components list-events` command.
