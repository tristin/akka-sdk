= Akka Platform features

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka Platform is based on a Kubernetes-based control plane and application plane for executing Akka services with fully-automated operations to enable elasticity, agility and resilience.

The fully-automated regions provide a broad set of functionality provided through Akka's control plane and infrastructure automation:

== Access management
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Users management, authorization | against organizations, projects, services
| OpenID Connect support | delegation of user and group management
| Management synchronization | synchronizing changes to users and authentication across every application plane
|===

== Cloud infrastructure automation
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Federated deployment | rolling out new application versions across many regions simultaneously
| Multi-tenancy | multiple users and organizations sharing the same compute, storage, and persistence
| Discovery | discovery of multiple Akka regions
| Connectivity | mTLS setup within regions and for cross-region connectivity
| Clustering | a service automatically spans its Akka cluster across multiple cloud provider availability zones
| Kubernetes operators | mapping Akka apps to namespaces, roles and role bindings, mapping Akka services, secrets and routes to Kubernetes resources, admin management access to Akka apps deployed within Kubernetes including Views, projections
| Auto-scaling | monitoring utilization to decide when additional instances of your Akka app should be added, removed, or resized from the cluster
| Disaster recovery | data stores are backed up in different locations
|===

== Development structure
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Projects | create and manage projects that have shared users for collaborative development, deployment, and operations
| Access tokens | access, refresh, and service tokens accessible to CI/CD and Akka developers
| JWTs and ACLs | validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for HTTP authentication, signing JWTs, allowing fine-grained invocation restrictions
| Packing | coordinating the release of new application versions across registries in multiple regions
| Akka Runtime | Managed JVM and Akka runtime that attach to Akka apps, can be updated and patched  independently of Akka apps without having to repack, redeploy, or restart the Akka service
|===

== Networking
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Firewall | VPC peering, ingress traffic routing.
| Ingress | Let’s Encrypt TLS termination, client certificate CA validation, client certification authorization, Auto configuration of Akka routes for each service with TLS cert provisioning
|===

== Observability
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Aggregation | metrics, logs, traces are collected and aggregated to user-configured telemetry destinations whether the embedded metrics server or 3rd party service like Splunk or DataDog
| Data management | credentials for the event store are dynamically generated for Akka services and injected into the runtime automatically; all data in motion, data at rest, and sourced keys are encrypted. Regular, automatic key rotation through Data Encryption Keys and Key Encryption Keys.
| Heap dump collection | automatically capture JVM heap dumps in certain error scenarios
