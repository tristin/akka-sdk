include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

AI coding assistants can increase your productivity when developing Akka services. This guide will give you some practical hints of how to setup Akka knowledge and how to prompt the AI assistant. We are using https://www.qodo.ai[Qodo, window="new"] and https://www.cursor.com[Cursor, window="new"] as examples of such coding assistants, but the techniques are applicable for other tools as well.

Some key benefits of using an AI coding assistant:

* **Scaffolding:** Quickly create a foundational structure for your Akka services, ready to be filled with business logic.
* **Faster learning:** Accelerate your understanding and application of Akka concepts.
* **Code comprehension:** Get an overview explanation of existing codebases or sample applications.
* **Debugging:** Get assistance in identifying and resolving issues.
* **Test generation:** Rapidly generate tests to ensure code correctness.

In summary, we will look at the following:

. Akka documentation in LLM-friendly format
. Configure your AI assistant (Cursor, Qodo, etc.) to use this documentation
. Include relevant sample code as additional context
. Use our coding guidelines template for better code generation
. Follow the prompt examples for common Akka development tasks

== Why doesn't AI know about latest Akka?

The LLMs have been trained on web content that didn't include the latest documentation of the Akka SDK. If you ask it questions about Akka it will answer based on the knowledge it was trained on, which most certainly was about the Akka libraries. Some assistants will try to use web search to retrieve the latest information, but that is typically not enough and not an efficient way for a coding assistant. For example, if you ask:

```
What are the core components of Akka?
```

it will answer something like

```
Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications...
1. Actor System ...
2. Actors ...
...
```

This is correct for the Akka libraries but not helpful when developing with the Akka SDK.

We need to give the LLM knowledge about the latest Akka documentation.

== LLM-friendly documentation

In addition to human-readable HTML, the Akka documentation is also published in markdown format that an LLM can understand in a good and efficient way. Each page has a corresponding `.md` page, for example https://doc.akka.io/java/event-sourced-entities.html.md[event-sourced-entities.html.md, window="new"].

The markdown documentation is published according to the widely used standard proposal https://llmstxt.org[llmstxt, window="new"]:

* https://doc.akka.io/llms.txt[llms.txt, window="new"] - website index
* https://doc.akka.io/llms-full.txt[llms-full.txt, window="new"] - full, concatenated, documentation
* https://doc.akka.io/llms-ctx.txt[llms-ctx.txt, window="new"] - full documentation without the optional parts of llms.txt
* https://doc.akka.io/llms-ctx-full.txt[llms-ctx-full.txt, window="new"] - full documentation including the optional parts of llms.txt

== Setup AI assistant to use the Akka documentation

We need to make the AI coding assistant aware of the latest Akka documentation. Different assistants support this in different ways, and we will use Cursor and Qodo as two examples of how to do it.

=== Cursor

Cursor can use documentation from a custom website, and include relevant information to the LLM by similarity search of that content.

You can point it directly to `https://doc.akka.io/llms-full.txt`, which is already in LLM-friendly markdown format.

Alternatively, you could use `https://doc.akka.io/java/` as the base URL of the custom docs, and it would crawl the HTML pages. It's important to point at `https://doc.akka.io/java/`, and not `https://doc.akka.io/` since the latter also includes documentation about the Akka libraries that you don't want to use when developing with the Akka SDK.

You find the settings for custom documentation in: Cursor Settings > Features > Docs

In the chat window it is important that you include the Akka documentation as context. Type `@Docs` - tab, and select the custom Akka docs that you added in the settings.

=== Qodo

For Qodo you need to download the markdown documentation files and include them in the project directory. Qodo will index the content and include relevant information to the LLM.

. Download the link:../java/_attachments/akka-docs-md.zip[akka-docs-md.zip].
. Unzip the content and place in a folder `akka-context/` in your development project.
. Add `akka-context/` to your `.gitignore` file, if you use git.

NOTE: It would have been more convenient to only download `llms-full.txt`, but currently it seems like Qodo can't handle a large file like that.

In the chat window it is important that you include the Akka documentation as context. Click `Add context` and select `Files and folders` and select `Full project` or the `akka-context` folder.

Make sure that you download the latest documentation regularly to make use of documentation improvements and new features.

=== Verify that it works

To verify that the assistant now knows about Akka, we can ask the question again:

```
What are the core components of Akka?
```

it should answer with something like

```
1. Event Sourced Entities ...
2. Key Value Entities ...
3. HTTP Endpoints ...
...
```

== Include sample source code

Even though the documentation includes comprehensive code snippets it can be good to include the full source code of one or a few samples. This makes it easier for the coding assistant to follow the same structure as the sample.

. Pick one or a few samples from xref:java:samples.adoc[], which are relevant to what you are developing. If you are just getting started learning Akka you can pick the Shopping Cart sample.
. Clone the sample Github repository. Pull latest if you have already cloned the repository before.
. Copy the source code to a folder `akka-context/` in your development project, e.g. `akka-context/travel-agent/src`.
. Add `akka-context/` to your `.gitignore` file, if you use git.

Include the samples (`akka-context/`) as context in the chat window.

Make sure that you pull the latest samples regularly to make use of improvements and new features.

== Coding guidelines

The coding assistant will generate more accurate code if we give it some detailed instructions. We have prepared such xref:java:ai-coding-assistant-guidelines.adoc[guidelines] that you can use as a template.

At the beginning of your chat session include a prompt like this:

```
Don't generate any code yet, but remember the following guidelines and use them when writing code in this project.

<paste guidelines>
```

You can copy-paste the guidelines from https://doc.akka.io/java/ai-coding-assistant-guidelines.html.md[ai-coding-assistant-guidelines.html.md, , window="new"]

== Prompt examples

Here are some examples of prompts that you can use as templates when giving instruction to the coding assistant.

=== General advise

* Develop incrementally and don't ask for too much at the same time.
* Compile and test after each step using `mvn test` or `mvn verify`. Fix compilation errors and test failures before proceeding too far.
* Commit the changes often so that you can compare and revert if something goes wrong.
* Be precise in the instructions and make corrections by further instructions if it doesn't generate what you want.
* Even with custom docs, AI might still occasionally "hallucinate" or provide slightly off answers. It's important to include time for human review in the development loop.
* Make sure that the AI does not introduce security vulnerabilities. You are still responsible for the generated code.
* Some things are just easier with ordinary IDE tooling, such as simple refactoring.

=== Entities

```
Create a credit card entity, use the shopping cart sample as template.
```

That will probably generate an event sourced entity, but you can be more specific by saying "event sourced entity" or "key value entity."

To matches your business domain you should be more precise when it comes to what to include in the domain objects. Start small, and iterate.

```
Let's add a unit test for the entity
```

Ensure it uses the `EventSourcedTestKit`, which is described in the coding guidelines.

=== Endpoints

```
Add an http endpoint for the entity
```

```
Add example curl commands for the endpoint to the readme
```

```
Add an integration test for the endpoint
```

Ensure it uses the integration test is using the `httpClient` of the `TestKitSupport`, which is described in the coding guidelines.

=== Views

```
Add a View that lists brief credit card information given a cardholder name
```

```
Add an integration test for the view
```

```
Include the endpoint for the view in the existing CreditCardEndpoint
```

```
add example curl commands for that in the readme
```

=== Workflow

```
Create a Workflow that transfers money from an external bank service to the credit card. It should have the following steps:
- withdraw
- deposit
- compensate-withdraw

The transitions for a transfer:
- starts with the bank withdrawal
- if withdrawal was successful it continues with the credit card deposit
- if the deposit fails for some reason it should return the money to the bank account in the compensate-withdraw step
```

=== Runtime errors

If you see an error message when running the application or tests you can try to ask the assistant for help finding the bug. Paste the error message in the chat question.
