= akka projects hostnames add

Add a hostname to a project

== Synopsis

The `akka project hostnames add _name_' command will add a hostname to the project.
The name is optional.
If not specified, you will be assigned a random hostname by Akka.
Names must be valid hostnames that have a CNAME record that resolves to the ingress address for the region you wish to use it on.
