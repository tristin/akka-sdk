/**
 * A service follow the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern (see
 * https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-guide/concepts/cqrs.html).
 *
 * <p>Entities represent the command side where you change the state of your model in a strictly
 * consistent and isolated manner. Views represent the query side of your application. Views are
 * optimized for reads and allow you to query your model by fields other than the entity identifier.
 *
 * <p>A View implementation consists of two parts:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>One or more static public inner classes extending {@link TableUpdater}. Each concrete class
 *       is responsible for consuming events from one source, Event Sourced Entity events, Key Value
 *       Entity state changes or messages from a message broker Topic. and emitting a state that is
 *       stored in one table of the view.
 *   <li>One or more query methods annotated with queries for the tables of the view. Query methods
 *       define the type of query parameters, if any as their input, and the type of the returned
 *       result as the type parameter of <code>QueryEffect&lt;T&gt;</code>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The query strings and table field types defines which fields should be indexed and how the
 * query will be executed.
 *
 * <p>The query is executed by the runtime when a request is made to the View.
